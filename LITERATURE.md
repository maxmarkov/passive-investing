__Introduction__. The active management strategy tend to systematically underperform a passive benchmark index. The best performing stocks often perform significantly better than the other stocks in the index. Thus, the average index returns depend heavily on a relatively small set of winners. The authors developed a model where random selection of a subset of securities from an index maximizes both the chances of outperforming the index and underperforming the index, with the latter chances being greater than the former.

A large positive skewness in returns creates a problem for activemanagement. The non-symmetric shape of the distribution of returns means that random selection will deliver a median return that is worse than the average of the full index of the securities. In reality, the histogram of returns to the securities in an index will change year-to-year. **Missing (or underweighting) the securities that significantly outperform other securities is a strong headwind for an active manager to overcome.**
